## Launch Scope — What's on the site on Day 1

### Content (16 existing + new)
- [ ] Review all 16 posts — are they substantial enough? Several are very short (3 paragraphs)
- [ ] Expand thin posts to 800-1200 words with real data, costs, comparisons
- [ ] Add 4-6 new cornerstone articles (longer, deeper, SEO-targeted)
- [ ] All posts need proper internal linking strategy
- [ ] All affiliate CTAs need real destination URLs (not just blueaperenewables)

### SEO Essentials
- [ ] Meta titles + descriptions on every page (OpenGraph, Twitter cards)
- [ ] Canonical URLs
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data (Article schema for posts, Organization for site)
- [ ] sitemap.xml (auto-generated or static)
- [ ] robots.txt
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy on all pages

### Design & UX
- [ ] Homepage needs work — currently just "Home" title + intro text
- [ ] Blog listing — consider showing excerpts not full posts (page is very long)
- [ ] Mobile nav working ✅
- [ ] Footer links — replace placeholder # links with real pages or remove
- [ ] Favicon + social share image

### Technical
- [ ] Domain DNS switch (Vercel custom domain setup)
- [ ] SSL certificate (automatic via Vercel)
- [ ] Redirects from any changed URLs (if WordPress had different paths)
- [ ] Google Search Console setup
- [ ] Google Analytics or Plausible
- [ ] Core Web Vitals check
- [ ] 404 page

### Affiliate Setup
